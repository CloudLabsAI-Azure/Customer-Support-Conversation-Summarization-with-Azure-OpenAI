## Understand natural language processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

- Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
- Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
- Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
- Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

## Natural language processing in Microsoft Azure

You can use Microsoft's **Azure AI Language** to build natural language processing solutions. Some features of Azure AI Language include understanding and analyzing text, training conversational language models that can understand spoken or text-based commands, and building intelligent applications.

Microsoft's **Azure AI Speech** is another service that can be used to build natural language processing solutions. Azure AI Speech features include speech recognition and synthesis, real-time translations, conversation transcriptions, and more.

## Key features for conversation summarization

Conversation summarization supports the following features:

- **Issue/resolution summarization:** A call center specific feature that gives a summary of issues and resolutions in conversations between customer-service agents and your customers.
