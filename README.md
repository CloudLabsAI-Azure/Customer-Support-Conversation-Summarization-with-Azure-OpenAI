## Understanding Azure's AI Language Service 

Azure AI Language Service is a managed cloud service that simplifies the development of natural language processing (NLP) applications. With minimal machine-learning expertise required, it allows users to: 

- **Identify Key Terms and Phrases:** Quickly extract significant words and expressions from text.
  
- **Analyze Sentiment:** Determine the emotional tone behind words to understand the context better.
  
- **Summarize Text:** Condense long documents into shorter, digestible summaries using both extractive and abstractive techniques.
   
- **Build Conversational Interfaces:** Create intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants that can engage with users naturally. 

## Key Features

- **Extractive summarization:** Produces a summary by extracting salient sentences within the document.

- **Multiple extracted sentences:** These sentences collectively convey the main idea of the document. They're original sentences extracted from the input document's content. 

- **Rank score:** The rank score indicates how relevant a sentence is to a document's main topic. Document summarization ranks extracted sentences, and you can determine whether they're returned in the order they appear, or according to their rank. 

- **Multiple returned sentences:** Determine the maximum number of sentences to be returned. For example, if you request a three-sentence summary extractive summarization returns the three highest scored sentences.

- **Abstractive summarization:** Generates a summary that doesn't use the same words as in the document but captures the main idea.

- **Summary texts:** Abstractive summarization returns a summary for each contextual input range within the document. A long document can be segmented so multiple groups of summary texts can be returned with their contextual input range. 

- **Contextual input range:** The range within the input document used to generate the summary text.
